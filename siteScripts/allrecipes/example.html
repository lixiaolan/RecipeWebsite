<h1>Smothered Chicken Breasts</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon lemon pepper seasoning</li>
<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
<li>8 strips bacon</li>
<li>1 onion, sliced</li>
<li>1/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
<li>1/2 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>Sprinkle chicken with salt and lemon-pepper.</p>

<p>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook the chicken breasts in hot oil until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 13 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove and keep warm.</p>

<p>Place bacon in large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; reserve 2 tablespoons drippings. Cook and stir onion and brown sugar in reserved drippings until onion is golden, about 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Place two bacon strips on each chicken breast half; top with caramelized onions and sprinkle with Colby-Monterey Jack cheese.</p>
