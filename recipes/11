<h1>Asparagus and Tofu Stir fry</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li> toasted sesame oil</li>
<li> 8 ozs extra firm tofu (cut into slices thick as a pencil)</li>
<li>4 green onions (thinly sliced)</li>
<li> 1 tbsp ginger (freshly grated, peeled)</li>
<li>1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes</li>
<li>1 bunch asparagus (trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces)</li>
<li>1 pinch salt (fine-grain sea)</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic (chopped)</li>
<li>1 handful cashew nuts (toasted, chopped up a bit)</li>
<li>3 handfuls spinach (or chopped kale, or chopped chard)</li>
<li>1 lime</li>
<li>2 tbsps hoisin sauce</li>
<li>1 handful fresh mint (slivered)</li>
<li>1 handful fresh basil (slivered)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Have all your ingredients prepped and within arms reach of the stove. Heat a splash of sesame oil in a large pan, or well-seasoned wok over medium high heat. Alternately, you can do this in a dry non-stick pan - one of the few occasions I still use non-stick. When it is hot, add the tofu, and cook until golden - a few minutes. Remove the tofu from the pan and set aside.</p>

<p>Add another (generous) splash of oil to the pan and, as soon as it is hot, add the onions, ginger, red pepper flakes, asparagus, and salt. Stir fry for about a minute, then add the garlic, cashews, and spinach and stir-fry for another minute, or until the spinach wilts. Return the tofu to the pan. Stir in the lime zest and juice and the hoisin sauce. Cook for another 10-20 seconds, stirring all the while.</p>

<p>Remove from heat and stir in the mint and basil. Taste and add a bit more salt if needed.</p>
