<h1>Corn bread</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gluten-free!!!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>2 cups yellow cornmeal</li>
<li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
<li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
<li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>1 egg at RT, beaten</li>
<li>4 T unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
<li>1.5 cups plain yogurt, at RT (or buttermilk or sour cream)</li>
<li>4 T honey</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Preheat your oven to 400Â°F. Grease a 12-inch cast iron skillet or an 8-inch square or round pan, and set it aside.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, place the cornmeal, salt, baking soda and baking powder, and whisk to combine well. In separate bowl, mix the egg, butter, yogurt and honey, and whisk to combine well.</li>
<li>Create a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the wet ingredients.  Mix until just combined. The mixture will be relatively thin (thinner if you used buttermilk). Pour the mixture into the prepared pan. Bake for 20-30 minutes (closer to 20 minutes if using a cast iron skillet), or until lightly golden brown on top, golden brown around the edges, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Slice and serve immediately.</li>
</ul>
