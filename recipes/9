<li> 2 pounds green beans, trimmed </li>
<li> 2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
<li> 2 tablespoons butter </li>
<li> 1/4 cup thinly sliced shallots (2 medium) </li>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>Bring a large pot of salted water to boiling. Add green beans. Return to boiling; reduce heat. Cook, covered, for 8 to 10 minutes or until crisp-tender. Drain green beans in a colander. Run cold water over beans until chilled to stop the cooking and keep the beans bright green.</p>

<p>In an extra-large skillet heat oil and butter over medium heat. Add shallots; cook just until tender, stirring frequently. Add mushrooms; cook for 6 to 8 minutes or until tender, stirring frequently.</p>

<p>Add green beans. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes or until heated through, tossing occasionally. Add lemon peel, lemon juice, and thyme; toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. If desired, garnish with almonds.</p>
