<h1>Thai curry with Tofu</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Easy curry; red or green paste can be used; fried or soft-ish tofu</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>1 tbsp. peanut oil (canola or vegetable oil works too)</li>
<li>14 oz. extra-firm tofu, pressed for 30 minutes (you can use a tofu press), cut into triangles</li>
<li>1-13.5 oz. can light unsweetened coconut milk</li>
<li>1/4 c. red curry paste</li>
<li>3/4 c. vegetable broth</li>
<li>2 tsp. soy sauce or tamari</li>
<li>1 tbsp. light brown sugar</li>
<li>1 medium red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
<li>1 lb. asparagus, tough ends removed, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
<li>cooked rice or rice noodles, lime wedges, and cilantro leaves for serving</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Heat peanut oil in large wok or skillet over medium high heat. Add tofu triangles and cook for 5 minutes; flip tofu over and cook 5 minutes more on other side. Place tofu on a plate lined with paper towels (to soak up excess oil) and wipe out skillet (carefully!).</li>
<li>Return skillet to medium-high heat. Add 1/2 cup of coconut milk and cook, stirring constantly, until it thickens (about 2 minutes). Stir in red curry paste and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
<li>Add remaining coconut milk, broth, soy sauce, and sugar. Once sauce comes to a simmer, add red pepper; cook for 2 minutes. Stir in asparagus and cook 3 minutes more. Return tofu to skillet and stir until coated with curry sauce. Remove from heat and serve over noodles or rice; garnish with lime wedges and cilantro.</li>
</ul>
